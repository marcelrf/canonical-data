## Fields
### `name`
The country's common English name (generally the title chosen by the English Wikipedia for its article). This means, for example, using "Laos" rather than "Lao People's Democratic Republic" and "Bolivia" rather than "Bolivia (Plurinational State of)".

### `iso_code`
The country's [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code or equivalent.

> **Warning**
> Nambia has the code `NA`. By default, `pandas.read_csv` interprets this as a null. To prevent this, you can use the `na_filter=False` parameter.

### `economic_region`
A classification of the country as ["Global North" or "Global South"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South).

### `maxmind_continent`
The country's continent according to MaxMind's databases.

### `is_protected`
